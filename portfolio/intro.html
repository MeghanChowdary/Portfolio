                    <p><b>Project 1: [Ayurvedic Encyclopedia]</b><br>
                        The main aim of the website is to help the user
                        to know about ayurvedic herbs, plants, and giving online
                        suggestions for user to prevent or cure illness through
                        Ayurveda. The need of such website had been raised from the
                        time of CORONA. This website helps the people who are
                        unable to come out of the house to cure their disease due to
                        their personal reasons, so they can use this website, which is
                        easy to use.
                        <br>
                        Our project focuses on creating awareness upon ayurveda
                        and gives the information to the user. The application starts
                        working after the user open the website using URL, once the
                        user enter the first page of website there will be three main
                        sections. This website helps the people who avoid taking of
                        Allopathy medicine for a small health issue and helps the
                        people who only uses Ayurvedic medicines.
